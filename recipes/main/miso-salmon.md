# Miso Salmon with Sushi Rice and Garlic Butter Spinach

## Ingredients

**For the Rice:**
- 200g sushi rice
- 250g water
- 1 tsp fine salt
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1½ tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 2 sheets nori seaweed
- 2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds

**For the Salmon:**
- 500g skinless salmon fillets
- 4 spring onions

**For the Sauce:**
- 4 garlic cloves
- 3 tbsp miso paste
- 3 tbsp sriracha

**For the Soy Butter Spinach:**

## Instructions

1. Rinse sushi rice until water runs clear. Add to a saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to low heat and cook for 12 minutes. Turn off heat and let rest covered for 10 minutes.
2. Make the sauce by grating garlic into a bowl and whisking in miso paste, sriracha, fish sauce, honey and rice wine vinegar. Cut salmon into large cubes (about 3 per fillet), toss in sauce and marinate in the fridge.

4. Thinly slice garlic and melt butter in a medium pan over medium heat. Cook garlic for 3 minutes until softened. Add spinach and wilt, then season with soy sauce and lemon juice.
5. Air fry salmon at 240°C for 3-4 minutes. Heat rice in microwave if needed. Thinly slice spring onions.
6. Serve rice in bowls topped with salmon and sauce. Add garlic butter spinach, spring onions and extra nori if desired.
