# Broccoli Pasta

## Ingredients

- 2 heads broccoli
- 75ml olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic
- 4 tbsp black olives
- 4 anchovies
- 1 pinch chilli
- Â½ lemon
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch black pepper
- 400g rigatoni

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to boil. Cut broccoli florets off, halving the larger ones.
2. Peel tough skin from broccoli stalks and cut into 1cm thick strips, then into thumb-sized rectangles.
3. Boil broccoli florets and stalks for 5 minutes until tender.
4. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over low-medium heat. Chop olives. Add garlic (crushed whole or chopped), olives, chilli and anchovies to the oil.
5. Cook garlic gently for a few minutes without browning. Transfer broccoli from boiling water to the pan with some pasta water. The anchovies will dissolve.
6. Cook pasta in the broccoli water until al dente. While cooking, mash broccoli with the back of a wooden spoon to create a creamy sauce. Add lemon juice and turn off heat.
7. Add cooked pasta to the broccoli pan with a splash of pasta water. Toss over medium heat until well coated. Season to taste.
8. Serve with olive oil, pepper and extra chilli if desired.
9. Enjoy!
